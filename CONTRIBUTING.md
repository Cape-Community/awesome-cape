# Contributing Guidelines

## What you may contribute

This is a tailored list for places of interest in Cape Girardeau county, however places nearby Cape (less than an hour's drive) may also be considered.

Please do not submit common restaurant chains and stores (with the exception of events being held). While McD's may have your favorite nugs (and sometimes they really do be good), it's not a particularly defining characteristic of what makes the Cape area unique.

Don't just list the name of a place, please add a short description as to what makes the place worth visiting.
